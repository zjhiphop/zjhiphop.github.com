<div><h3>Positioning Models</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Positioning Models</strong> introduces and demonstrates the six positioning models.</li>
<li><strong>Positioned</strong> explains, demonstrates, and contrasts the four values of the position
property: static, absolute, fixed, and relative.</li>
<li><strong>Closest Positioned Ancestor</strong> shows how absolute boxes can be positioned
relative to any ancestor element rather than just the element’s parent.</li>
<li><strong>Stacking Context</strong> shows how positioned boxes can be stacked behind or in front
of static elements and each other.</li>
<li><strong>Atomic explains</strong> how to render inline content in a block rather than on a block.</li>
<li>**Static explains the basics of normal flow.</li>
<li><strong>Absolute</strong> shows how to remove any element from the normal flow and position it
absolutely with respect to the inside of the border of its closest positioned ancestor.</li>
<li><strong>Fixed</strong> shows how to remove any element from the normal flow and position it
absolutely with respect to the viewport.</li>
<li><strong>Relative</strong> shows how to use relative positioning to control stacking order, or offset
an element without affecting its shape or the position of other elements.</li>
<li><strong>Float and Clear</strong> shows how you can remove an element from the normal flow and
float it to the left or right side of its parent. It also shows how to clear elements so
that they’re positioned below floats on the left, right, or both sides.</li>
<li><strong>Relative Float</strong> shows how you can relatively position a float.

<h3>Positioning: Indented, Offset, and Aligned</h3></li>
<li><strong>Indented</strong> shows how to indent an element from the sides of its container.</li>
<li><strong>Offset Static</strong> shows how to offset an element from surrounding elements.</li>
<li><strong>Offset or Indented Static Table</strong> shows how to offset a table from its container.</li>
<li><strong>Offset Float</strong> shows how to offset a float from surrounding floats and content.</li>
<li><strong>Offset Absolute and Offset Fixed</strong> shows how to offset an absolute element from
the position it would have had in the normal flow.</li>
<li><strong>Offset Relative</strong> shows how to offset any element without affecting other elements.</li>
<li><strong>Aligned Static Inline</strong> shows how to align inline elements horizontally and
vertically.</li>
<li><strong>Aligned and Offset Static Block</strong> shows how to align and offset static block
elements.</li>
<li><strong>Aligned and Offset Static Table</strong> shows how to align and offset tables.</li>
<li><strong>Aligned and Offset Absolute</strong> shows how to align and offset absolute elements.</li>
<li><strong>Aligned-center Absolute</strong> shows how to center absolute elements.</li>
<li><strong>Aligned Outside</strong> shows how to align elements to the outside of their container.

<h3>Positioning: Advanced</h3></li>
<li><strong>Left Aligned </strong> shows how to align an element to the left side of its container.</li>
<li><strong>Left Offset </strong> shows how to offset a left-aligned element.</li>
<li><strong>Right Aligned </strong> shows how to align an element to the right side of its container.</li>
<li><strong>Right Offset </strong> shows how to offset a right-aligned element.</li>
<li><strong>Center Aligned </strong> shows how to align an element to the center of its container.</li>
<li>**Center Offset shows how to offset a center-aligned element.</li>
<li><strong>Top Aligned </strong> shows how to align an element to the top of its container.</li>
<li><strong>Top Offset </strong> shows how to offset a top-aligned element.</li>
<li><strong>Bottom Aligned </strong> shows how to align an element to the bottom of its container.</li>
<li><strong>Bottom Offset </strong> shows how to offset a bottom-aligned element.</li>
<li><strong>Middle Aligned </strong> shows how to align an element to the middle of its container.</li>
<li><strong>Middle Offset </strong> shows how to offset a middle-aligned element.</li>
</ul></div>
